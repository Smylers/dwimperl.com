=title DWIM Perl - the Perl distribution that contains everything you'll ever need
=subtitle Do What I Mean, Perl

<p>
DWIM Perl was planned to be a the easy to start with Perl distribution.
It has a version for <a href="/windows.html">Microsoft Windows</a> that
contains Padre, the Perl IDE and all the CPAN modules you'll ever need.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="/linux.html">Linux version</a> was designed to be used primarily on servers. Thus it does not
contain the IDE but it contains all the CPAN modules you'll need.
