This is the source of the http://dwimperl.com/ web site



Web site design ideas:

DwimPerl itself does not yet have a logo. It needs one.
DWIM = Do What I Mean
Maybe something like "CPAN Inside" ?

Main page: logo of Dwimperl, and that of Windows and Linux (Penguin)
and Mac.

A sign up form for newsletter on every page I think.
(A single text box and a button)

Separate page for Windows, Linux and Mac.
Each page will have several sections for each type of the distribution:
desktop, server (once they are ready).

Show the logos of all the parts of Dwimperl
(e.g. Strawberry Perl on the Windows Page)

Padre,
Moose,
DBIx::Class
SQLite
Template Toolkit
etc.
